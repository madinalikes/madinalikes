### Hi, my name is Madina Zhaksylyk. My love for coding has led me to data analytics. What I do is transform data into a narrative with stunning visualizations to help people make informed decisions. I am a Bootcamp graduate from the Universtiy of Minnesota, Minneapolis equipped with skills in Python, Excel, Tableau and Javascript. When I am not coding or playing with data, I love go on runs, hikes, and travel to new places.
